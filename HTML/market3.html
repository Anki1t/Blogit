            The more you know about your marketing campaigns’ performance, the better you can tweak and improve them.
            Google’s Universal Analytics (UA) dashboard gives you an overview of the most important metrics and reports for
            your campaigns. It provides an easy-to-read performance ‘snapshot’ that clearly shows key trends to clients,
            managers, and other non-analysts.
    
            Note: Universal Analytics was an upgrade on the previous version of Google Analytics. It, in turn, will be
            replaced with GA4 in 2023. You can find out more in our essential guide to GA4.
    
            UA reports can give you a bird’s-eye view of campaign performance in several key areas, including:
    
            Audience: Who is coming to your website?
            Acquisition: How are users getting to your website?
            Behavior: What are users doing on your website?
            Conversions: What actions are users taking to complete set goals?
            Events: What non-standard actions are people taking on your website?
            Note: Don’t just rely on UA for all your reporting data. You can get a wealth of insights from other sources
            too!
    
          
            The first major reporting category in Universal Analytics tells you about the types of visitors who come to your
            website. You can access audience overview information to identify top-line statistics and information about
            audience activity, including GEO locations and lifetime value.
    
            
            With this report, you can view demographics information, such as the age and gender of your visitors. It can be
            very useful to learn more about the types of people that visit your website.
    
            
            You can delve a little deeper into visitor motivations with the Interests Report. This report lets you view
            information about user interests. You can look at affinity categories, in-market segments, and other interest
            categories that help you understand the browsing patterns of your visitors.
    
           
            It's always important to know where your visitors are physically located, so you can use the Geo Report to view
            the language and location of your website visitors. Use this data to enhance your media targeting and to help
            you find clusters of high-value customers in different locations.
    
            
            With the Audience Behavior Report, you can see behavioral information about your users. For example, you could
            use this report to find information on new versus returning users, frequency of user visits, engagement levels,
            session quality, and conversion probability.
    
            
            This report provides information about the browsers, networks, and operating systems being used by your
            audience. This is a useful report for troubleshooting compatibility issues with certain browsers.
    
            
            The Mobile Report enables you to view traffic and conversion data from mobile and desktop users, as well as the
            devices being used. This is particularly important for understanding how people search, browse, and buy or
            convert on your site on different devices.
    
           
            As journeys may start and finish on different devices, the Cross Device Report aims to show you the overlap
            between mobile, desktop, and tablet devices in driving traffic and activity on your site.
    
            There are four main reports in the cross device area:
    
            Device Overlap shows the number of users who use multiple devices to access your website.
            Device Paths shows the device journeys that users typically take.
            Cross Device Channels shows the channels that drive traffic and conversions across devices.
            Acquisition Device shows the number of new users by device type.
            Benchmarking Report
            The Benchmarking Report is useful for competitive analysis, as it allows you to see aggregate statistics for
            other sites in the same category as your website across channels, locations, and devices.
    
            UA Reports: Acquisitions
            
            The Acquisition Tab allows you to identify the sources of traffic to your website in a series of sub-reports
            based on traffic type. This can help you to discover which channels are most effective, and which are not
            performing as well as you’d hoped.
