      Travelling means going from one place to another in different purposes.
      They also explore to see the unseen and know the unknown. The travellers
      always travel the most beautiful places of the world which uphold the
      existence of nature. All things are created by Allah. There are many
      means to see the unseen and know the unknown, but travelling is the best
      of all. For example: Reading books gives us literal knowledge, listening
      story gives us indefinite ideas, but travelling gives us visual as well
      as concrete knowledge. At the same time, people do not travel in the
      same purposes. Someone travels to gain knowledge and experience, someone
      travels for pleasure, someone travels for business purposes etc. There
      are different types of travelling like- travelling by air, bus, boat,
      train, bus etc. Every travelling has much educative value. It is a part
      of education. Our education and book knowledge remain imperfect without
      travelling. For this reason, we can learn many things by travelling. It
      teaches us trade and commerce, language, sociology, customs, culture,
      history, geography and so on. Therefore, the educative value of
      travelling beggars description. Besides, there are some special benefits
      of travelling. If a man stays at one place for a long time, he becomes
      monotonous and his life becomes boring and callous. Travelling removes
      our monotony and gives pleasure. Similarly, it also broadens our outlook
      and refreshes our mind. A good traveler can easily educate others. He
      can give us first-hand knowledge of men and matters of other country. I
      like travelling very much.

      Travelling is a hobby to people. There are people who love to travel
      with friends, with family, with colleagues or even alone. Travelling
      around the globe helps in exploring places. It is also required to
      provide break to self while working for months. It keeps our soul happy
      and relaxed. I believe, travelling once in six months is required for
      every person. It gives break from 9 to 5 job schedule. It is an
      investment that equips a person with practical knowledge. It keeps away
      stress, anxiety and depression. My favourite hobby is travelling.
