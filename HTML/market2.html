            Although corporations often espouse noble goals around the topics of diversity and inclusion, they need to move
            from sentiment into action and explore how to progress the narrative from a marketing exercise into something
            more cultural. This involves applying diversity and inclusion principles into not only their digital marketing
            content, but also into their day-to-day goals and activities.
    
            Some companies do this by setting up dedicated task forces to promote diversity and inclusion. Others
            incorporate these principles into their mission statements and business objectives. And others make it an
            integral part of their business practices, such as refusing to interact with businesses that don’t adhere to
            these principles.
    
            How can your company better promote diversity and inclusion? Let’s look at 5 key ways you can do it.
    
            5 ways digital marketers can promote inclusion and diversity
            Digital marketers can advocate for diversity and inclusion with their clients by:
    
            Raising awareness
            Understanding their audience
            Adjusting their message
            Gathering insights
            Driving change
            1. Raise awareness
            Digital marketers have a crucial role to play in raising awareness about diversity and inclusion. This can
            involve including more diverse ranges of people in their ads, or it can involve creating ads that specifically
            target people who may previously have been excluded from mainstream advertising. The We All Win campaign by
            Microsoft is a good example of this. It specifically highlights the needs of gamers with disabilities,
            challenging people’s stereotyped images of gamers.
    
    
            Of course, not every company has Microsoft’s advertising budget! But even small companies can start a
            conversation around whether their advertising reflects the broad spectrum of modern society or whether it
            perpetuates outdated preconceptions. Obviously, the more diverse advertising is, the more people it will appeal
            to.
    
            The Ad Council recently ran a series of PSA videos in the US to show that love has no labels. Its aim was to get
            people to think beyond traditional ideas of love and embrace its diversity. Underneath our superficial
            differences, we all look very similar behind an x-ray machine. Love includes all people.
    
    
            2. Understand your audience
            The 20212 Bruce Springsteen Superbowl ad for Jeep divided viewers. On the one hand, the ad appeals to Jeep’s
            target audience, with its inspiring rugged landscapes, folksy feel, cowboy bravura, and musings about “a chapel
            in Kansas” that lies at the heart of America. However, the symbols used in the ad also alienated many people,
            who saw them as symbols of bigotry, fear, and division. Many people viewing the ad felt that it wasn’t speaking
            to them.
    
            As a digital marketer, you need to find ways to craft your message so that it resonates with your target
            audience without, at the same time, excluding or alienating other people. Marketing must reach out beyond the
            core audience and embrace new potential customers
