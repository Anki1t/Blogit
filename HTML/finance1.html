            Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or
            fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of understanding, rationality,
            kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking in order to distinguish
            education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an improvement of the
            student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. In a slightly different sense, education
            may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process: the mental states and dispositions
            possessed by educated people. Education originated as the transmission of cultural heritage from one
            generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of
            learners, skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex vocational skills.
            <br>
            Types of education are commonly divided into formal, non-formal, and informal education. Formal education
            takes place in education and training institutions, is usually structured by curricular aims and objectives,
            and learning is typically guided by a teacher. In most regions, formal education is compulsory up to a
            certain age and commonly divided into educational stages such as kindergarten, primary school and secondary
            school. Nonformal education occurs as addition or alternative to formal education.[1] It may be structured
            according to educational arrangements, but in a more flexible manner, and usually takes place in
            community-based, workplace-based or civil society-based settings. Lastly, informal education occurs in daily
            life, in the family, any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
            considered educational, whether unintentional or intentional. In practice there is a continuum from the
            highly formalized to the highly informalized, and informal learning can occur in all three settings.[2] For
            instance, homeschooling can be classified as nonformal or informal, depending upon the structure.
            <br>
            Regardless of setting, educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion, and
            directed research. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. Education is supported by a variety of
            different philosophies, theories and empirical research agendas.
            <br>
            There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education towards
            relevance in students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future society at large, or for
            evidence-based education methodologies. A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the
            United Nations.[a] Global initiatives aim at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes
            quality education for all.
