            As long as we are a full six days before fall begins, I am allowed to sneak in one more zucchini recipe.
            It would be right there in my contract, had I one, above the expectation of ironed shoelaces and below that
            of a daily slice of chocolate biscuit cake. I’d actually intended this recipe for July (and the eggplant
            involtini for August). But July was so hot, and August wasn’t much better; I couldn’t bring myself to
            publish recipes that require oven time, so I waited for a better moment to arrive. Our patience has been
            rewarded; this brothy, late summer-y bowl of pasta and meatballs is absolutely perfect for right now, with
            the kind of sunny warm days that require a morning and evening cardigan — i.e. the very best weather on this
            earth, full stop.As long as we are a full six days before fall begins, I am allowed to sneak in one more

            this week but something has come up — something good! — we are going to need one more week to get everything
            in order. I can’t wait to share everything with you; I hope we get to hang out this fall/winter.
