            Hi, my name is Dana DiTomaso. I'm President at Kick Point. And I am here today at MozCon
            2022 to bring you some details on the exciting world of Google Analytics 4, which I know all
            of you are like, "Ugh, I don't want to learn about analytics," which is totally fair. I also
            did not want to learn about analytics.

            And then I kind of learned about it whether I liked it or not. And you should, too,
            unfortunately.

            So I think the biggest thing about the move from Universal Analytics to GA4 is that people
            are like the y log in and everything looks different. "I don't like it." And then they leave.
            And I agree the user interface in GA4 leaves a lot to be desired. I don't think there's
            necessarily been a lot of good education, especially for those of us who aren't analysts on
            a day-to-day basis.

            We're not all data scientists. I'm not a data scientist. I do marketing. So what I'm hoping
            is I can tell you the things you should know about GA4 on just a basic sort of level, so
            that you have a better vocabulary to talk about it when people are horrified by the move to
            GA4, which is inevitable. It's going to happen. You've got to get it on your site starting
            basically immediately, if you don't already have it. So I started out with three things, and
            then I realized there was a fourth thing. So you get a bonus, exciting bonus, but we'll
            start with the first three things.

            1. It's different
            So the first thing it's different, which I know is obvious. Yes, of course, Dana it's
            different. But it's different. Okay, so in Universal Analytics, there were different types
            of hits that could go into analytics, which is where hits came from originally as a metric
            that people talked about. So, for example, in Universal Analytics, you could have a
            pageview, or you could have a transaction, or you could have an event.

            And those were all different types of hits. In GA4, everything is an event. There is a
            pageview event. There is a transaction event. There is, well, an event event. I mean, you
            name the events whatever you want. And because of that, it's actually a lot better way to
            report on your data.

            So, for example, one of the things that I know people always wanted to be able to report on
            in Universal Analytics is what pages did people see and how did that relate to conversion
            rate. And that was really tricky because a pageview was something that was at the hit scope
            level, which means it was just like the individual thing that happened, whereas conversion
            rate is a session scoped thing.

            So you couldn't mash together a hit scope thing with pageview with conversion rate, which is
            session scoped. They just didn't combine together unless you did some fancy blending stuff
            in Data Studio. And who's got time for that? So now in GA4, because everything is an event,
            you have a lot more freedom with how you can slice and dice and interpret your data and
            figure out what pages do people engage with before they actually converted, or what was that
            path, not just the landing page, but the entire user journey on their path to conversion. So
            that part is really exciting.

            2. Engagement rate is not reverse bounce rate
            Second thing, engagement rate is a new metric in GA4. They do have bounce rate. They did
            recently announce it. I'm annoyed at it, so we're going to talk about this a little bit.
            Engagement rate is not reverse bounce rate. But it is in GA4.

            So in Universal Analytics, bounce rate was a metric that people reported on all the time,
            even though they shouldn't have. I hate bounce rate so much. Just picture like a dumpster
            fire GIF right now across your screen. I hate bounce rate. And why I hate bounce rate is
            it's so easily faked. Let's say, for example, your boss says to you, "Hey, you know what,
            the bounce rate on our site is too high. Could you fix it?"

            You're like, "Oh, yeah, boss. Totally." And then what you do is whenever somebody comes on
            your website, you send what's called an interactive event off to Google Analytics at the
            same time. And now you have a 0% bounce rate. Congratulations. You got a raise because you
            made it up. Bounce rate could absolutely be faked, no question. And so when we moved over to
            GA4, originally there was no bounce rate.

            There was engagement rate. Engagement rate has its own issues, but it's not measuring
            anything similar to what bounce rate was. Bounce rate in UA was an event didn't happen. It
            didn't matter if you spent an hour and a half on the page reading it closely. If you didn't
            engage in an event that was an interactive event, that meant that you were still counted as
            a bounce when you left that page.

            Whereas in GA4, an engage session is by default someone spending 10 seconds with that tab,
            that website open, so active in their browser, or they visited two pages, or they had a
            conversion. Now this 10-second rule I think is pretty short. Ten seconds is not necessarily
            a lot of time for someone to be engaged with the website.

            So you might want to change that. It's under the tagging settings in your data stream. So if
            you go to Admin and then you click on your data stream and you go to more tagging settings
            and then you go to session timeouts, you can change it in there. And I would recommend
            playing around with that and seeing what feels right to you. Now GA4 literally just as I'm
            filming this has announced bounce rate, which actually it is reverse engagement rate. Please
            don't use it.

            Instead, think about engagement rate, which I think is a much more usable metric than bounce
            rate was in UA. And I'm kind of excited that bounce rate in UA is going away because it was
            [vocalization]..
