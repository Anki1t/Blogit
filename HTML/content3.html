            Education is that pillar in human life, that makes the structure of life more sustainable. What if the
            process of building that structure is erroneous?. Our education system needs a change. While we all
            understand how crucial education is to shape our lives, it has also been a major problem in our country.
            There are several issues that the Indian education system is grappled with.
            An inappropriate education system swells the stress and anxiety factor amongst students. One of the major
            problems with the system are,
            Less Practical more theories:
            In today’s world, students need much more to prepare themselves for the job market. The thing that has not
            changed is the impact a teacher can have on the life and learning of a student. The present education system
            is not sufficient. It is mainly based on theoretical knowledge rather than practical knowledge.
            Lacks in specialization:
            After 10th standard, students have to choose the stream according to their area of interest. Likewise, if
            you choose commerce or technical subjects you have to learn about theories either helpful in the future or
            not. Students should get specialization in which they want to succeed in the future or the subjects which
            are gonna help them in their higher studies.
            Non-Global approach:
            Indian education system lacks amendments, we follow the 5 or 6 years before amended syllabus which is too
            local. We are taught Management by making us mug up the definitions, Henry Fayol's 14 principles of
            management and if we quote it in exams we become Management students, Stupidity. Where is the case study? Is
            Management supposed to be learned this way? The same applies to other subjects.
            Introduction of technology:
            We all know we have incepted in the era of the fourth industrial revolution. We are living the renaissance
            of technology and in such a state, technology and education system cannot be kept apart. Students must be
            taught about technology right from the early years of their education so that it does not come like an alien
            thing in their later times. Indian schools must embrace technology and education with an open heart and
            propagate the same to the students as it is there, where their future lies.

            India has produced the world’s greatest entrepreneurs, engineers, doctors, scientists, and artists who are
            doing exceedingly well in their careers, but these are just figures of few people. Why is it that most
            people aren’t successful in India? The reason is that our education system falls behind a lot of countries
            in the world
            As is evident, to make any positive tread, we have to revise the education system entirely. First and
            foremost, teaching should be viewed as a respectable profession because when teachers themselves and other
            sections of the society start viewing the profession with respect, teachers tend to work more seriously
            towards educating the child rather than teaching them. Secondly, one board should be applicable in the whole
            country with different instruction languages depending on the state with revision in the curriculum every 2
            years to promote comprehensive development. Thirdly, schools should be located in the vicinity of every
            village with proper sanitation and food facilities and the curriculum should be inclusive of gender studies,
            mannerisms. Further, classrooms should be open to discussions on sensitive topics so that the set of
            stereotypes can be broken.

            India is a huge country and there are going to be barriers at every step. But AARK Technology Hub as a
            company always works with a positive mindset. A positive mindset makes the way easy. So if we and you people
            together want to bring a positive change always remember “Where there is a Will, there is a Way.”
