      Food is an extremely important source of energy in humans and other
      living organisms. It is vital for the growth and development of the
      body. It helps in performing day to day activities in an efficient way.
      It promotes immunity, repairs cells and strengthens bones and muscles to
      perform basic functions of the body. Most importantly, it provides
      nourishment to physical and mental health.

      We cannot deny the importance of food in our lives. As it is the basic
      need to survive. Yet some people waste not thinking that there are still
      some people that do not get any of it. We should always be careful while
      taking a meal on our plates. In other words, we should take only that
      much that our stomach can allow. Or else there will be wasting of food.
      In India there are many people living in slums, they do not have proper
      shelter. Moreover, they are not able to have even a one-time meal. They
      starve for days and are always in a state of sickness. Many children are
      there on roads who are laboring to get a daily meal. After seeing
      conditions like these people should not dare to waste food. Moreover, we
      should always provide food to the needy ones as much as we can.
