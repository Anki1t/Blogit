      To travel from one place to another for different purposes is generally
      called travelling. People do not travel always for the same purposes.
      Someone travels to gain knowledge and experience, someone travels for
      pleasure, someone travels for business purposes etc. It has much
      educative value. It is a part of education. Our education and book
      knowledge remain imperfect without travelling. We can learn many things
      from travelling. It teaches us to trade and commerce, language,
      sociology, customs, culture, history, geography and so on. Therefore,
      the educative value of travelling beggars description. Besides this,
      there are some special benefits of travelling. If a man stays in one
      place for a long time, he becomes monotonous. Travelling removes our
      monotony and gives pleasure. It also broadens our outlook and refreshes
      our mind. A good traveller can easily educate others. He can give us
      first-hand knowledge of men and matters of another country. I like
      travelling very much.

      Travelling means to go from one place to another either on foot or by
      any kind of vehicle the situation allows. Man is by nature and necessity
      a traveling or movie being. It is, so to speak, his inborn habit and
      interest to know the unknown, to see the unseen, to enjoy the unenjoyed
      things with a view to filling his mind with new ideas, knowledge,
      thoughts, and experience. Travelling is an important way to gain
      knowledge and acquire education. It gives the first-hand knowledge to
      the traveler and the books give the second-hand knowledge. Bookish
      knowledge can be had from reading books the and practical knowledge can
      be had from traveling. Hence traveling In regarded as a part of
      education. During traveling a traveler visits different places both
      historical and general and comes in touch with people of different
      regions, faiths, customs, and languages.
