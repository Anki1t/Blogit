            One of the major changes that occurred in traditional marketing was the "emergence of digital marketing", this
        led to the reinvention of marketing strategies in order to adapt to this major change in traditional marketing.

        As digital marketing is dependent on technology which is ever-evolving and fast-changing, the same features
        should be expected from digital marketing developments and strategies. This portion is an attempt to qualify or
        segregate the notable highlights existing and being used as of press time.[when?]

        Segmentation: More focus has been placed on segmentation within digital marketing, in order to target specific
        markets in both business-to-business and business-to-consumer sectors.
        Influencer marketing: Important nodes are identified within related communities, known as influencers. This is
        becoming an important concept in digital targeting.[52] Influencers allow brands to take advantage of social
        media and the large audiences available on many of these platforms.[52] It is possible to reach influencers via
        paid advertising, such as Facebook Advertising or Google Ads campaigns, or through sophisticated sCRM (social
        customer relationship management) software, such as SAP C4C, Microsoft Dynamics, Sage CRM and Salesforce CRM.
        Many universities now focus, at Masters level, on engagement strategies for influencers.
        To summarize, Pull digital marketing is characterized by consumers actively seeking marketing content while Push
        digital marketing occurs when marketers send messages without that content being actively sought by the
        recipients.

        Online behavioral advertising is the practice of collecting information about a user's online activity over
        time, "on a particular device and across different, unrelated websites, in order to deliver advertisements
        tailored to that user's interests and preferences."[53][54] Such Advertisements are based on site retargeting
        are customized based on each user behavior and pattern.
        Collaborative Environment: A collaborative environment can be set up between the organization, the technology
        service provider, and the digital agencies to optimize effort, resource sharing, reusability and
        communications.[55] Additionally, organizations are inviting their customers to help them better understand how
        to service them. This source of data is called user-generated content. Much of this is acquired via company
        websites where the organization invites people to share ideas that are then evaluated by other users of the
        site. The most popular ideas are evaluated and implemented in some form. Using this method of acquiring data and
        developing new products can foster the organization's relationship with its customer as well as spawn ideas that
        would otherwise be overlooked. UGC is low-cost advertising as it is directly from the consumers and can save
        advertising costs for the organization.
        Data-driven advertising: Users generate a lot of data in every step they take on the path of customer journey
        and brands can now use that data to activate their known audience with data-driven programmatic media buying.
        Without exposing customers' privacy, users' data can be collected from digital channels (e.g.: when the customer
        visits a website, reads an e-mail, or launches and interact with a brand's mobile app), brands can also collect
        data from real-world customer interactions, such as brick and mortar stores visits and from CRM and sales
        engines datasets. Also known as people-based marketing or addressable media, data-driven advertising is
        empowering brands to find their loyal customers in their audience and deliver in real time a much more personal
        communication, highly relevant to each customers' moment and actions.[56]
        An important consideration today while deciding on a strategy is that the digital tools have democratized the
        promotional landscape.

        Remarketing: Remarketing plays a major role in digital marketing. This tactic allows marketers to publish
        targeted ads in front of an interest category or a defined audience, generally called searchers in web speak,
        they have either searched for particular products or services or visited a website for some purpose.
        Game advertising: Game ads are advertisements that exist within computer or video games. One of the most common
        examples of in-game advertising is billboards appearing in sports games. In-game ads also might appear as
        brand-name products like guns, cars, or clothing that exist as gaming status symbols.
        Six principles for building online brand content:[57]

        Do not consider individuals as consumers;
        Have a editorial position;
        Define an identity for the brand;
        Maintain a continuity of contents;
        Ensure a regular interaction with audience;
        Have a channel for events.
        The new digital era has enabled brands to selectively target their customers that may potentially be interested
        in their brand or based on previous browsing interests. Businesses can now use social media to select the age
        range, location, gender, and interests of whom they would like their targeted post to be seen. Furthermore,
        based on a customer's recent search history they can be ‘followed’ on the internet so they see advertisements
        from similar brands, products, and services,[58] This allows businesses to target the specific customers that
        they know and feel will most benefit from their product or service, something that had limited capabilities up
        until the digital era.

        Tourism marketing: Advanced tourism, responsible and sustainable tourism, social media and online tourism
        marketing, and geographic information systems. As a broader research field matures and attracts more diverse and
        in-depth academic research[59]
        Ineffective forms of digital marketing
        Digital marketing activity is still growing across the world according to the headline global marketing index. A
        study published in September 2018, found that global outlays on digital marketing tactics are approaching $100
        billion.[60] Digital media continues to rapidly grow. While the marketing budgets are expanding, traditional
        media is declining.[61] Digital media helps brands reach consumers to engage with their product or service in a
        personalized way. Five areas, which are outlined as current industry practices that are often ineffective are
        prioritizing clicks, balancing search and display, understanding mobiles, targeting, viewability, brand safety
        and invalid traffic, and cross-platform measurement.[62] Why these practices are ineffective and some ways
        around making these aspects effective are discussed surrounding the following points.

        Prioritizing clicks
        Prioritizing clicks refers to display click ads, although advantageous by being ‘simple, fast and inexpensive’
        rates for display ads in 2016 is only 0.10 percent in the United States. This means one in a thousand click ads
        is relevant therefore having little effect. This displays that marketing companies should not just use click ads
        to evaluate the effectiveness of display advertisements.[62]

        Balancing search and display
        Balancing search and display for digital display ads is important. marketers tend to look at the last search and
        attribute all of the effectiveness of this. This, in turn, disregards other marketing efforts, which establish
        brand value within the consumer's mind. ComScore determined through drawing on data online, produced by over one
        hundred multichannel retailers that digital display marketing poses strengths when compared with or positioned
        alongside, paid search.[62] This is why it is advised that when someone clicks on a display ad the company opens
        a landing page, not its home page. A landing page typically has something to draw the customer in to search
        beyond this page. Commonly marketers see increased sales among people exposed to a search ad. But the fact of
        how many people you can reach with a display campaign compared to a search campaign should be considered.
        Multichannel retailers have an increased reach if the display is considered in synergy with search campaigns.
        Overall both search and display aspects are valued as display campaigns build awareness for the brand so that
        more people are likely to click on these digital ads when running a search campaign.[62]

        Understanding Mobiles
        Understanding mobile devices is a significant aspect of digital marketing because smartphones and tablets are
        now responsible for 64% of the time US consumers are online.[62] Apps provide a big opportunity as well as
        challenge for the marketers because firstly the app needs to be downloaded and secondly the person needs to
        actually use it. This may be difficult as ‘half the time spent on smartphone apps occurs on the individuals
        single most used app, and almost 85% of their time on the top four rated apps’.[62] Mobile advertising can
        assist in achieving a variety of commercial objectives and it is effective due to taking over the entire screen,
        and voice or status is likely to be considered highly. However, the message must not be seen or thought of as
        intrusive.[62] Disadvantages of digital media used on mobile devices also include limited creative capabilities,
        and reach. Although there are many positive aspects including the user's entitlement to select product
        information, digital media creating a flexible message platform and there is potential for direct selling.[63]

        Cross-platform measurement
        The number of marketing channels continues to expand, as measurement practices are growing in complexity. A
        cross-platform view must be used to unify audience measurement and media planning. Market researchers need to
        understand how the Omni-channel affects consumer's behavior, although when advertisements are on a consumer's
        device this does not get measured. Significant aspects to cross-platform measurement involve deduplication and
        understanding that you have reached an incremental level with another platform, rather than delivering more
        impressions against people that have previously been reached.[62] An example is ‘ESPN and comScore partnered on
        Project Blueprint discovering the sports broadcaster achieved a 21% increase in unduplicated daily reach thanks
        to digital advertising’.[62] Television and radio industries are the electronic media, which competes with
        digital and other technological advertising. Yet television advertising is not directly competing with online
        digital advertising due to being able to cross platform with digital technology. Radio also gains power through
        cross platforms, in online streaming content. Television and radio continue to persuade and affect the audience,
        across multiple platforms.[64]

        Targeting, viewability, brand safety, and invalid traffic
        Targeting, viewability, brand safety, and invalid traffic all are aspects used by marketers to help advocate
        digital advertising. Cookies are a form of digital advertising, which are tracking tools within desktop devices,
        causing difficulty, with shortcomings including deletion by web browsers, the inability to sort between multiple
        users of a device, inaccurate estimates for unique visitors, overstating reach, understanding frequency,
        problems with ad servers, which cannot distinguish between when cookies have been deleted and when consumers
        have not previously been exposed to an ad. Due to the inaccuracies influenced by cookies, demographics in the
        target market are low and vary.[62] Another element, which is affected by digital marketing, is ‘viewability’ or
        whether the ad was actually seen by the consumer. Many ads are not seen by a consumer and may never reach the
        right demographic segment. Brand safety is another issue of whether or not the ad was produced in the context of
        being unethical or having offensive content. Recognizing fraud when an ad is exposed is another challenge
        marketers face. This relates to invalid traffic as premium sites are more effective at detecting fraudulent
        traffic, although non-premium sites are more so the problem.
