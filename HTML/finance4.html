        <p>
            The 2007–09 global financial crisis spurred important policy debates on oversight of the banking industry.
            As discussed in the Global Financial Development Report 2019/2020, after the crisis, bank regulations and
            supervision became more complex, potentially reducing transparency. This development represents a burden in
            developing countries, especially low-income countries, where supervisory resources and capacity are limited.
            In this regard, the recent COVID-19 shock presents an unprecedented challenge for financial authorities as,
            for example, bank asset quality is expected to deteriorate and policy action is needed to prevent and
            mitigate the negative effects associated with high and rapid increases in nonperforming loans (NPLs) (see
            World Development Report 2022, chapter 2, for an in-depth discussion).

            What is more effective in affecting bank behavior? How do regulations and supervisory actions interact? What
            are the conditions under which a binding regulation and effective supervision work best? These questions are
            especially important for the design and enforcement of prudential regulation in developing countries where
            the institutional environment is weak (see, for example, Anginer, Demirgüç-Kunt, and Mare, 2018). Yet, the
            difference between banking regulation and supervision is blurred in the academic literature. The vast
            majority of empirical studies focus largely on the impact of the former, often not properly articulating the
            distinction between supervisory and regulatory initiatives and referring to them interchangeably (Hirtle and
            Kovner, 2020). However, the economic and juridical implications of the issuance of non-legally binding
            supervisory guidance are materially different from those resulting from the passage of a hypothetically
            identical regulation.

            In a recent study, we provide an empirical assessment of whether banks respond differently to the adoption
            of supervisory guidance compared to a specular regulatory action. To do so, we study the staggered and
            distinct supervisory and regulatory implementations of a reform aiming at tackling the issue of persistently
            high levels of NPLs held by European banks, generally referred to as the European calendar provisioning.
            This initiative is unique for three main reasons. First, it leaves aside the existing arrangements
            characterized by a global harmonized effort toward banking regulation as it was introduced as a unilateral
            regulatory change. As such, the regulatory reform was exogenous to financial policy in developing countries.
            Second, its underpinning idea subverts the principles established by the Basel capital agreements
            themselves, introducing a simple and transparent mechanism to reduce NPLs. Indeed, rather than relying on
            banks’ internal models and capital adequacy assessments, these new rules impose minimum loss coverage
            requirements to be achieved through write-downs or deductions from regulatory capital, depending
            mechanically on the time elapsed since the default of the considered loan. Third, the complex process of
            adoption and enforcement of the European calendar provisioning represents a unique setting to analyze
            whether banks respond differently to the adoption of supervisory guidance issued under the “comply or
            explain framework” compared to a specular regulatory action (figure 1).

            Note: ECB = European Central Bank; EBA = European Banking Authority.
            The staggered supervisory and regulatory actions sparked a heated debate on two major issues. First, the
            European calendar provisioning brought regulation back in time by foregoing model-based analyses of the risk
            associated with loan exposures to rely on a simple measure of time elapsed . Second, these interventions
            called into question the degree to which supervisory guidance issued under the comply or explain framework
            is perceived to be binding by commercial banks, compared to the legally compulsory nature of regulatory
            actions.

            Building on this discussion, we empirically analyze whether the introduction of the European calendar
            provisioning is effective in improving the performance of European banks. To address this question within a
            causal framework, our empirical strategy relies on a dynamic difference-in-differences approach, comparing
            changes in the riskiness, performance, and loan policies of subsidiaries of European banks operating in
            developing countries with those of comparable domestic banks. Because European banks consolidate worldwide
            credit exposures under their domestic regulatory framework, their subsidiaries operating in developing
            countries are directly affected by the adoption of the calendar provisioning rules. Conversely, matched
            banks operating in developing countries are not exposed to the effects of these supervisory and regulatory
            actions.

            Note: The P-values of the two-sample unequal variance t-test of equality of means between domestic banks and
            EU subsidiaries are 0.38 (2015), 0.51 (2016), 0.07 (2017), 0.03 (2018), and 0.00 (2019).
            Our analyses show that European banks reacted to the release of the European Central Bank’s calendar
            provisioning supervisory guideline by treating it as a binding requirement and decreasing their NPL ratios
            (figure 2). In our base model, depending on the specification, in 2017, subsidiaries of European banks
            relatively decreased their NPL ratios by between 1.3 and 2.6 percentage points, or 22% and 44% of the sample
            mean of European subsidiaries , a sizable reduction. The estimated effect further increased in 2018 and
            2019, although by marginally less. The recognition of these losses in banks’ income statements as
            charge-offs induced an immediate reduction in their regulatory capital (Tier 1 capital) and impaired loan
            reserves, weakening their capitalization profile. Yet, we document that these persistently higher regulatory
            costs did not cause a reduction in loan origination. Rather, subsidiaries of European banks appear to have
            shifted these increased compliance costs to their customers by charging higher interest rates on new loans.
            Importantly, we further identify that banks primarily target countries featuring weaker definitions of
            capital requirements and NPLs to implement this form of regulatory cost-shifting, which is consistent with
            multinational banks exploiting the regulatory leniency of foreign countries to offload at least part of the
            regulatory costs imposed by domestic regulations and apply lower bank lending standards.
